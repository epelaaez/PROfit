/**
 * @brief Standard three-flavour long-baseline oscillation model, in matter or in vacuum.
 * @details Wraps the NuFastLBL library (Denton, arXiv:2405.02400) to compute the full 3x3
 * oscillation probability matrix. Two model tags share this class:
 *  - `LBL_3nu-matter_angles` (legacy alias `LBL`): constant-density matter oscillations
 *    via NuFastLBL::Probability_Matter_LBL.
 *  - `LBL_3nu-vacuum_angles`: vacuum oscillations via NuFastLBL::Probability_Vacuum_LBL
 *    (cheaper, and finite for every dmsq_31 including the Dmsqee=0 crossing where the
 *    matter solver is singular).
 *
 * Kinematic inputs (event-by-event `<variable>`s, like every oscillation model);
 * E is always signed, negative = antineutrino (NuFast's convention):
 *  - `<parameter name="L">` [km] + `name="E"` [GeV]: exact per-event kinematics, for a
 *    baseline that varies across the MC. The evaluation grid is n_L x n_E GLOBAL bins,
 *    so keep both truth binnings lean. `baseline=` is a fatal conflict here.
 *  - `name="E"` alone + the `baseline=` attribute [km, REQUIRED in this mode]: fixed
 *    baseline, 1D grid over E — the cheap form most experiments want.
 *  - A single signed `name="L/E"` [km/GeV]: vacuum only, since the matter potential
 *    scales with E alone and the ratio underdetermines it. `baseline=` is fatal here.
 *  - E == 0 (or L/E == 0) is treated as the no-oscillation limit (identity probabilities).
 * NOTE (v3.0.4-dev): before this version the model took one `"L/E"` parameter that was
 * silently passed to NuFast as E [GeV] at a fixed L = 1300 km — older LBL configs must
 * migrate to the inputs above.
 *
 * Matter-only `<model>` attributes (the vacuum tag warns and ignores them; defaults
 * are the legacy hardcoded values):
 *  - `density=` [g/cm^3, >= 0, default 3 — note 3 is the legacy value, not DUNE's 2.848],
 *  - `electron_fraction=` [(0,1], default 0.5],
 *  - `n_newton=` [int 0-10, default 0; NuFast recommends 1 for many-year DUNE/HK precision].
 *
 * Parameters: dmsq_21, dmsq_31 [eV^2, linear], sin^2(theta_12), sin^2(theta_13),
 * sin^2(theta_23) [linear], delta_CP [rad, linear]. None are stored in log10 space.
 * The matter regime sets a model_constraint rejecting the narrow dmsq_31 band around
 * 0 and around Dmsqee = 0 (dmsqee_guard) where NuFast's DMP solver is singular; the
 * vacuum solver has no such band.
