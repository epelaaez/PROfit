---

**PROfit** is a fast, modern C++ framework for frequentist fits of
short-baseline neutrino oscillation and BSM physics models, developed for the
SBN/ICARUS program. You describe your entire analysis, be it MC files, selections,
binning, oscillation model, and systematic uncertainties, in a single XML
file, and PROfit turns it into spectra, covariance matrices, response splines,
and statistically rigorous fits and confidence regions.

## Highlights

- **One XML, one binary.** A single `PROfit` executable with subcommands for
  every stage of an analysis: `process`, `plot`, `global`, `profile`,
  `surface`, `fc`, `fc-adaptive`, `mcmc`, `scale-test`.
- **Event-by-event MC reweighting** with cached binary event stores — read
  your ROOT ntuples once, then iterate on fits in seconds. Caches are
  hash-validated against the XML, so stale inputs are caught automatically.
- **Flexible systematics**: CAFAna-style response splines, SBNfit-style
  fractional covariances, flat normalizations, detector-variation samples,
  MC-stat errors, and covariance↔spline conversion via eigenmode
  decomposition,  all freely mixed, with optional Gaussian priors and
  correlations.
- **Three χ² metrics** : standard covariance (`PROchi`), combined
  Neyman-Pearson (`PROCNP`), and Poisson  likelihood — behind
  one common interface, with analytic and Gauss-Newton gradient modes.
- **A robust global fitter**: Latin-hypercube sampling → particle-swarm
  optimization → multi-start L-BFGS-B, with tunable presets from `fast` to
  `overkill` and harmonic-oscillation seeding for Δm²-like parameters.
- **Multithreaded 1D profiles and 2D surfaces** with cross-thread warm-start
  seed banks, plus adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for surfaces.
- **Feldman-Cousins done properly**: classic per-point FC and an adaptive
  Feldman-Cousins (`fc-adaptive`) pipeline that builds a meta-mesh, grows
  pseudo-experiment banks level-by-level, and produces sensitivity/Brazil
  bands at a fraction of the brute-force cost.
- **PROjector two-stage fits**: fit a constraining sample (e.g. a near
  detector) once, save the posterior as a correlated prior, and re-use it in
  downstream fits, profiles, surfaces, and FC — projection without
  approximation [Under Development!]
- **Multiple physics models** out of the box (3+1, 3+2, two-flavor, LBL,
  simple scaling) with a clean base class for adding your own.
- **Deterministic and tested**: seeded runs are bit-reproducible, and a
  regression test suite covering every major workflow ships in
  [`tests/`](tests/README.md).

Built on [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen) for all internal linear algebra,
[LBFGSpp](https://github.com/yixuan/LBFGSpp),
 and ROOT for input/output and some plot making

## Installation

PROfit needs **ROOT**, **Boost**, **HDF5**, and **CMake ≥ 3.x** available in
your environment (via `apt-get`, `homebrew`, or your experiment's software
stack). Smaller dependencies (Eigen, LBFGSpp, CLI11, TinyXML2, …) are fetched
and built automatically by CMake.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markrosslonergan/Elephant_Vanishes.git
cd Elephant_Vanishes/build
cmake ..
make -j4                     # → build/bin/PROfit
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/bin   # optional
```

<summary>Setting up dependencies on the FNAL gpvms</summary>

Inside an SL7 container:

```bash
source /cvmfs/larsoft.opensciencegrid.org/setup_larsoft.sh
setup root v6_28_12 -q e26:p3915:prof
setup cmake v3_27_4
setup hdf5 v1_12_2b -q e26:prof
setup boost v1_82_0 -q e26:prof
```

PROfit aims to stay generic across versions, but the above combination is
confirmed to compile and run on the gpvms.

<details>
<summary>Python interface (pybind11)</summary>

With ROOT, HDF5, and Boost available globally:

```bash
python -m venv env && . env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install wheel setuptools pybind11 numpy==2.0.2
pip install git+https://github.com/markrosslonergan/Elephant_Vanishes
```

Then `import profit` in a Python shell, use the Python executables
(`PROsurf.py`, …), or run the binaries via the `PRO` helper (`PRO PROsurf`).
For development, clone the repo and `pip install .` from the checkout,
re-running it after changes.

</details>

## Quick start

Every PROfit command takes an XML config (`-x`) and an analysis tag (`-t`):

```bash
# One-time: read the MC ROOT files and cache event store + systematics
PROfit -x analysis.xml -t MyTag process

# Plot CV spectra with error bands and covariances
PROfit -x analysis.xml -t MyTag plot

# Global best fit
PROfit -x analysis.xml -t MyTag global

# 1D profiled Δχ² for every physics and nuisance parameter (8 threads)
PROfit -x analysis.xml -t MyTag -n 8 profile

# 2D Δχ² surface over the physics parameters
PROfit -x analysis.xml -t MyTag -n 8 surface

# Feldman-Cousins for an injected signal
PROfit -x analysis.xml -t MyTag -n 8 --inject dmsq 1.0 fc
```

`PROfit --help` and `PROfit <subcommand> --help` document every option;
`--fit-help` explains the fitter presets. The
[tutorial](docs/tutorials/PROfit_Tutorial_v2.md) walks through all of this on
a realistic two-detector example.

## How it works

```
XML config
   │  (parsed by PROconfig — owns all binning/bookkeeping)
   ▼
CAF/MC ROOT files ──► process ──► <TAG>_prop.bin + <TAG>_syst.bin
   │                             (event store + systematics, read ONCE,
   │                              hash-checked against the XML forever after)
   ▼
PROsyst (splines + fractional covariances)     PROpeller (per-event MC)
   │                                                │
   └──────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
                      ▼
   χ² metric (PROchi / PROCNP / Poisson) ⇐ binds config, MC, systs, model, data
                      ▼
   PROfitter (Latin hypercube → particle swarm → L-BFGS-B)
                      ▼
   global fit / profile / surface / FC / adaptive-FC / PROjector
                      ▼
   <TAG>_<out>_*.root, *.pdf, *.txt
```

PROfit is deliberately a *fitting* framework, not an end-to-end analysis
framework: it expects a final-stage selection as input and gives you fast,
reproducible statistical inference on top of it.

## Versioning

Development happens on the **`project-SBN-dev`** branch (the v2 release
line). The v1→v2 update made breaking XML changes — v1.x configs will not
work with v2 binaries, and bugfixes are not back-ported to v1.1. Use the
latest v2 tag for anything new.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. Before opening a PR that touches
physics code, run the deterministic regression suite
